prompt = """Find all jules sessions that need plan approval.

1. Use jules_list_sessions to get all sessions
2. Filter for sessions with state AWAITING_PLAN_APPROVAL
3. For each one, summarize:
   - Session ID
   - Title (if available)
   - Repository/source
   - When it was created

If there are sessions awaiting approval, ask if the user wants to:
- View details of a specific session (/jules:session ID)
- Approve a plan (/jules:approve ID)
- View the plan's activities (/jules:activities ID)

If no sessions need approval, let the user know."""
