prompt = """Show a summary of all active jules sessions.

1. Use jules_list_sessions to get all sessions
2. Filter for sessions that are NOT completed or failed (active states).

3. Group and summarize by state using these indicators:
   - ✋ AWAITING_PLAN_APPROVAL (Action needed: Approve)
   - 💬 AWAITING_USER_FEEDBACK (Action needed: Reply)
   - 🟢 IN_PROGRESS (Working...)
   - 💭 PLANNING (Thinking...)
   - ⚫ QUEUED (Waiting...)

4. For each active session, show:
   - Status Icon & State
   - Session ID
   - Title
   - Suggested next action (e.g., "Use /jules-ruby:approve <ID>")

Make the summary easy to scan."""
