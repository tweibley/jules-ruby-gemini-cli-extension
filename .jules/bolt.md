## 2024-05-22 - [Buffer handling in Node.js spawn]
**Learning:** When handling stdout from spawned processes in Node.js, `stdout.setEncoding('utf8')` is not only safer for multi-byte characters but also significantly faster than manually collecting chunks and converting them (or concatenating strings from buffers) for large outputs in V8.
**Action:** Always use `setEncoding('utf8')` for text streams from child processes unless raw binary data is explicitly required.
